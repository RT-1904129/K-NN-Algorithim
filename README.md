# K-NN-Algorithm
Here I write all K-NN Algorithm  by ownself and I Created a model(**Plastic Type Detector**) Which Based on KNN algorithm \
AnyOne can use this Algorithm of KNN to make there Model.By this I know how Devlopers Design KNN Algorithm.If you go throught Each file You Wll Understood How I design K-NN Algorithm \
If you go throught Each file You Will Understood How I design KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) Algorithm \
I made model **Plastic Type Detector** mention in  "The given Problem Statement.pdf" \
The Prediction F-1 score of my **Plastic Type Detector** model on the given test set is **F-1 Score: 0.99**
